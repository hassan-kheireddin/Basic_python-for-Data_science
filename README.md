## Project 1: Python Basics

This project introduces core Python concepts, including:

- Lists, Tuples, Sets, and Dictionaries
- Working with Time and Date
- Exception Handling (try-except)
- Lambda Functions
- Creating a Custom Python Module

This project builds a strong foundation for writing efficient and structured Python code.

## Project 2: NumPy and Image Processing

This project focuses on **NumPy**, a powerful library for numerical computing, and its applications in image processing. Topics covered include:

- Understanding NumPy arrays and operations
- Image representation as NumPy arrays
- Basic image transformations such as grayscale conversion and filtering
- Working with libraries like OpenCV or Pillow (PIL) for image manipulation

This project is essential for learning how data can be processed efficiently using NumPy.

## Project 3: Data Visualization with Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn

This project covers **data manipulation and visualization**, using:

- **Pandas** for handling and processing structured data
- **Matplotlib** for creating basic plots
- **Seaborn** for advanced data visualization techniques

By working on this project, you'll learn how to explore and present data effectively.

## Project 4: Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

This project explores **OOP in Python**, including:

- Classes and Objects
- Inheritance and Polymorphism
- Encapsulation and Abstraction
- Magic Methods (`__init__`, `__str__`, etc.)
- Advanced OOP Concepts such as Mixins and Metaclasses

Understanding OOP is crucial for writing modular and scalable Python applications.

## Project 5: Data-Oriented Design and Advanced Python

This project delves into **advanced Python concepts** and **efficient coding practices**, including:

- Data-Oriented Design (DOD) and memory-efficient programming
- Nonlocal Variables and Scope Management
- Decorators and Wrapper Functions
- Factory of Decorator Functions for reusable components

These topics help in writing high-performance and well-structured Python applications.
